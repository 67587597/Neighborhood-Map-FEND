# Project Details
I made mape with 5 locations markers, each one with infoWindow.
I used wekipedia API to get some informations to the infowindow, and I used knockout to creat viewmodel that filter search a list of locations items.
also I made some animation when a mouse hover on the marker or when slected from the list.
